    "### When DDC is Better\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clustered data**: DDC preserves cluster structure better than Random\n",
    "- **Spatial coverage**: DDC ensures all clusters are represented\n",
    "- **Distributional fidelity**: DDC better preserves marginal distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Random Might Be Better\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Very large datasets** (n >> k) with complex non-Gaussian structure\n",
    "- **Preserving exact global covariance** is critical\n",
    "- **High-dimensional sparse data**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Try `multimodal_clusters.ipynb` for more complex cluster structures\n",
    "- Try `adaptive_distances.ipynb` for advanced features (presets, adaptive distances)\n",
    "- See `docs/DDC_ADVANTAGE_CASES.md` for comprehensive analysis"
